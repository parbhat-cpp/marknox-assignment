                    Hello! My name is Parbhat Sharma, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Government Autonomous College, Rourkela. I am set to graduate in 2025. During my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in computer science principles and practical skills, which I have applied in various projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have gained hands-on experience in web and mobile application development, specializing in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) for web applications and Next.js for server-rendered React applications. Additionally, I have explored mobile app development using Flutter, a versatile framework that allows for the creation of beautiful and efficient cross-platform applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey into the world of software development has been enriched by a full-stack developer internship, where I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects. This experience not only honed my technical skills but also provided me with valuable insights into the collaborative and iterative nature of software development. I learned to navigate complex codebases, optimize performance, and ensure a seamless user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am passionate about learning new technologies and continuously improving my skills. My academic and practical experiences have equipped me with the ability to tackle challenging problems and develop innovative solutions. As I approach my final year of studies, I am eager to explore new opportunities in the tech industry, contribute to impactful projects, and continue my growth as a software developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn about me. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and organizations that share my enthusiasm for technology and innovation.
